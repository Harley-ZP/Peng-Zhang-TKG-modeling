# Peng-Zhang-TKG-modeling

This is Peng Zhang's TKG modeling project.

Things are still being uploaded.


Let's get the code running.

### Step 1:
    python preprocess.py
### Step 2:
    python mle_dirichlet.py
### Step 3(train the model):
    python main.py --cuda --do_train --reward_shaping
    
### Step 4(test the model):
    python main.py --cuda --do_test --IM




### logs_ICEWS14_log_from_baseline
    this path contains logs from our baseline model.
### log_
    this path content logs from our model recently
    if you rerun the experiments, a new path 'log' would be generated and it contains model and experiments record.
